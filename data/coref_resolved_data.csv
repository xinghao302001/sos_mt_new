153702,Promising efficacy of following a third dose of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients treated with anti-CD20 antibody who failed 2-dose vaccination,2022-05-01,"Anti-CD20 antibodies react with CD20 expressed not only on malignant B cells but also on normal B cells. It has been reported that these patients treated with anti-CD20 antibodies had an insufficient response to two-dose mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. To investigate the efficacy of a third dose in these patients, we investigated serum IgG antibody titers for S1 protein after third vaccination in 22 patients treated with anti-CD20 antibody who failed two-dose vaccination. Results showed that overall, 50 % of patients seroconverted. Although no patient who received a third dose within 1 year of the last anti-CD20 antibody administration showed an increase in S1 antibody titer, 69 % of patients who received a third dose more than 1 year after the last anti-CD20 antibody administration seroconverted. we data show that a third dose of vaccination is effective in improving seroconversion rate in patients treated with anti-CD20 antibody who failed standard two-dose vaccination.

153707,Forecast Intervals for Infectious Disease Models,2022-05-01,"Forecast intervals for infectious disease transmission and mortality have long been overconfident -- i.e., the advertised coverage probabilities of Forecast intervals for infectious disease transmission and mortality fell short of the advertised coverage probabilities of those intervals subsequent performances. Further, there was no apparent relation between how good models claimed to be ( as measured by the advertised coverage probabilities of those intervals purported forecast uncertainties ) and how good good models really were ( as measured by the advertised coverage probabilities of those intervals actual forecast errors ). The main cause of this problem lies in the misapplication of textbook methods for uncertainty quantification. A solution lies in the creative use of predictive tail probabilities to obtain valid interval coverages. This approach is compatible with all probabilistic predictive models whose forecast error behavior does not change too quickly over time. "
153709,Vaccine Stockpile Sharing For Selfish Objectives,2022-05-01,"The COVAX program aims to provide global equitable access to life-saving vaccines. However, vaccine protectionism by wealthy nations has limited progress towards vaccine sharing goals. For example, as of April 2022 only [ ~ ] 20 % of the population in Africa has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose. Here we use a two-nation coupled epidemic model to evaluate optimal vaccine-sharing policies given a selfish objectivein which countries with vaccine stockpiles aim to minimize fatalities in countries with vaccine stockpiles own populations. Despite the selfish objective, we find the selfish objective is often optimal for a donor nation to share a significant fraction of the selfish objective vaccine stockpile. Mechanistically, sharing a vaccine stockpile reduces the intensity of outbreaks in a donor nation, in turn reducing travel-associated incidence in a donor nation. This effect is intensified as vaccination rates decrease and epidemic coupling increases. Despite acting selfishly, vaccine sharing by a donor nation significantly reduces transmission and fatalities in a donor nation. Moreover, we find that there are hybrid sharing policies that have a negligible effect on fatalities in a donor nation compared to the optimal policy while significantly reducing fatalities in a donor nation. Altogether, these findings provide a rationale for nations with extensive vaccine stockpiles to share with other nations. "
153750,A role for super-spreaders in carrying malaria parasites across the months-long dry season,2022-05-02,"In malaria endemic regions, transmission of Plasmodium falciparum parasites is often seasonal with very low transmission during the dry season and high transmission in the wet season. Parasites survive the dry season within some individuals who experience prolonged carriage of parasites and are thought to seed infection in the next transmission season. We use a combination of mathematical simulations and data analysis to characterise dry season carriers and their role in the next transmission season. Simulating the life-history of individuals experiencing repeated exposure to infection predicts that dry season carriage is more likely in the oldest, most exposed and most immune individuals. This hypothesis is supported by data from a longitudinal study in Mali that shows that carriers are significantly older, experience a higher biting rate at the beginning of the next transmission season and develop clinical malaria later than non-carriers. Further, since the most exposed individuals in a community are most likely to be dry season carriers, We show that this is predicted to enable a more than 2-fold faster spread of parasites into the mosquito population at the start of the next transmission season.

153760,SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF A TUBERCULOSIS (TB) MATHEMATICAL MODEL,2022-05-03,"In this work, we have constructed a Mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of TB. Feasibility and positivity of the solutions a Mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis TB are determined and a Mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis TB is established that a Mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis TB is well posed and that the solutions are all positive. The disease-free equilibrium ( DFE ) is also determined and the basic reproduction number R0 is computed. Sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number R0 is conducted to find the model parameters a Mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis TB. a Mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis TB was therefore, observed through sensitivity analysis that TB induced death ( d ) has a high impact on R0 and varies inversely with R0. Graphical simulation of the model parameters was performed. Graphical simulation of the model parameters was observed that model parameters such as infection rate ( { beta } ), recruitment rate ( { pi } ) and rate of movement from latent to active TB ( ) are directly proportional to the basic reproduction numberR0. Finally, Graphical simulation of the model parameters is observed that the basic reproduction number R0 is a decreasing function of the recovery rate ( { gamma } ) and natural death rate ( ). "
153761,Medical journeys of victims of exploitation and trafficking: a retrospective cohort study using a large multi-state dataset and new ICD-10 codes,2022-05-03,"Trafficking and exploitation for sex or labor affects millions of persons worldwide, but millions of persons use of the healthcare system is not characterized systematically. In 2018 new ICD-10 codes were implemented in the United States ( US ) for diagnosis of patients who were victims of trafficking or exploitation but todate no comprehensive study reported on patients who were victims of trafficking or exploitation but todate no comprehensive study medical journeys. Our objective was to examine the extent to which newly implemented ICD-10 codes pertaining to human trafficking were being used in the healthcare system, and to characterize the care received by the victims. and FindingsDatabase search of a large US health insurer that contained approximately 43 million patients holding commercial or government-provided health insurance across the United States ( US ). For the dates 2018-09-01 to 2022-03-01, the dataset was found to contain 3,967 instances of 2018 new ICD-10 codes. In 31 % of the cases, 2018 new ICD-10 codes were used as the principal or admitting diagnosis. Regression analysis of 2018 new ICD-10 codes found a 2 % increase in the adoption of 2018 new ICD-10 codes. 2018 new ICD-10 codes were used by 1,532 distinct providers, the majority in non-hospital settings. The data contained 2301 patients of which 1025 were treated for recent exploitation or trafficking, which corresponds to identification of the latter patients, 90.1 %. the latter patients, 90.1 % were victims of sexual exploitation, and 9.9 % victims of labor exploitation. the latter patients, 90.1 % were predominantly female ( 81 % ), insured by Medicaid was 20 ( interquartile range15-35 ). Healthcare utilization over 12 months after diagnosis of trafficking was $ 32,192 ( standard deviation $ 160,730 )-much greater than average for Medicaid patients ( $ 6,556 per year in 2019 ). the victims were characterized by a high prevalence of mental health conditions, high utilization of the emergency department, and the victims persisted after diagnosis of exploitation. Surprisingly, 57 % of the victims were first diagnosed outside hospitals, primarily during office and psychiatric visits, and only 25 % were first diagnosed during an emergency department visit. 2018 new ICD-10 codes provide valuable insights into the profiles and medical journeys of victims of trafficking. However, adoption of 2018 new ICD-10 codes is not widespread, increasing by only 2 % per year and the majority of the victims are likely still not diagnosed by 2018 new ICD-10 codes. Greater adoption, when consistent with patient safety, may improve care coordination and outcomes. "
153697,HematoNet: Expert Level Classification of Bone Marrow Cytology Morphology in Hematological Malignancy with Deep Learning,2022-05-01,"There have been few efforts made to automate the cytomorphological categorization of the bone marrow cells. For bone marrow cell categorization, deep-learning algorithms have been limited to a small number of samples or disease classifications. In this paper, we proposed a pipeline to classify the bone marrow cells despite these limitations. Data augmentation was used throughout the data to resolve any class imbalances. Then, random transformations such as rotating between 0 { degrees } to 90 { degrees }, zooming in / out, flipping horizontally and / or vertically, and translating were performed. the proposed CoAtNet model used in a pipeline was a CoAtNet and that was compared with the EfficientNetV2 and ResNext50 models. we then analyzed the CoAtNet model using SmoothGrad and Grad-CAM, two recently developed algorithms that have been shown to meet the fundamental requirements for explainability methods. After evaluating all three models performance for each of the distinct morphological classes, the proposed CoAtNet model was able to outperform the EfficientNetV2 and ResNext50 models due to the proposed CoAtNet model attention network property that increased the learning curve for the algorithm which was represented using a precision-recall curve.

153699,Design and validation of HIV peptide pools for detection of HIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells,2022-05-01,"Reagents to monitor T cell responses to the entire HIV genome, based on well characterized epitopes, are missing. Evaluation of HIV-specific T cell responses is of importance to study natural infection, and therapeutic and vaccine interventions. Experimentally derived CD4 + and CD8 + HIV epitopes from the HIV molecular immunology database were developed into Class I and Class II HIV megapools ( MPs ). We assessed HIV responses in persons with HIV pre combined antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) ( n = 17 ) and post-cART ( n = 18 ) and compared these responses to 15 controls without HIV ( matched by sex, age, and ethnicity ). Using the Activation Induced Marker ( AIM ) assay, We quantified HIV-specific total CD4 +, memory CD4 +, circulating T follicular helper, total CD8 + and memory CD8 + T cells. We also compared the Class I and Class II HIV MPs to commercially available HIV gag peptide pools. Overall, HIV Class II MP detected HIV-specific CD4 + T cells in 21/35 ( 60 % ) HIV positive samples and 0/15 HIV negative samples. HIV Class I MP detected an HIV-specific CD8 + T cells in 17/35 ( 48.6 % ) HIV positive samples and 0/15 HIV negative samples. We innovative HIV MPs are reflective of the entire HIV genome, and its performance is comparable to other commercially available peptide pools. Here, We detected HIV-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses in people on and off cART, but not in people without HIV. "
153700,Brief: Implementation of a Novel Clinic/Community Partnership Addressing Food Insecurity Among Adults with HIV in the Southern United States,2022-05-01,"Food insecurity is highly prevalent among people with HIV. Traditional calorie-rich, nutrient poor food assistance programs may improve food security but increase risk for other chronic diseases. This case study describes the process evaluation of a novel clinic / community partnership to provide nutritionally adequate, tailored food assistance to adults with HIV in Alabama. used include semi-structured interviews with program staff at Birmingham AIDS Outreach and the University of Alabama at Birminghams 1917 HIV / AIDS Clinic, and analysis of descriptive characteristics of individuals enrolled in the food program for a minimum of one year between 2017-2019. The new program served 1,311 patients and enabled more than 300 previously lost-to-follow-up patients to re-engage in HIV care. The program implementation reviewed here can serve as a roadmap to develop clinic / community partnerships focused on a variety of health outcomes and quality of life among food insecure patients. "
153696,Medical text prediction and suggestion using generative pre-trained transformer models with dental medical notes,2022-05-01,"Generative pre-trained transformer ( GPT-2 ) models are one of the latest large pre-trained natural language processing ( NLP ) models, which enables model training with limited datasets, and reduces dependency on large datasets which are scarce and costly to establish and maintain. There is a rising interest to explore the use of GPT-2 models in healthcare. GPT-2 investigate the performance of GPT-2 and GPT-Neo models for medical text prediction using 374,787 free-text dental notes. GPT-2 fine-tune pre-trained GPT-2 and GPT-Neo models for next word prediction on a dataset of over 374,000 manually written sections of dental clinical notes. Each model was trained on 80 % of a dataset of over 374,000 manually written sections of dental clinical notes, validated on 10 %, and tested on the remaining 10 %. GPT-2 report model performance in terms of next word prediction accuracy and loss. Additionally, GPT-2 analyze the performance of GPT models on different types of prediction tokens for categories. GPT-2 annotate each token in 100 randomly sampled notes by category ( e.g. Names, Abbreviations, Clinical Terms, Punctuation, etc. ) and compare the performance of Each model by token category. Models present acceptable accuracy scores ( GPT-276 %, GPT-Neo53 % ), and the GPT-2 model also performs better in manual evaluations, especially for names, abbreviations, and punctuation. The results suggest that pre-trained models have the potential to assist medical charting in the future. GPT-2 share the lessons learned, insights, and suggestions for future implementations.

153703,Characteristics of admissions for Kawasaki Disease from 1997 to 2012: Lessons from a national database,2022-05-01,"A majority of large epidemiologic studies on Kawasaki Disease have come from Asia. There is paucity of data assessing Kawasaki Disease on a national level in the U.S., particularly in terms of hospitalization co-morbidities and cost. This study set forth to analyze data from the Kids Inpatient Database from 1997 to 2012. Data were analyzed for age, race, cardiogenic shock, acute kidney injury, liver failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, arrhythmia, and congenital heart disease. Additionally, multivariate regression analysis was performed to assess the impact of Kawasaki Disease on coronary artery aneurysms, ECMO, length of stay, cost of stay, and mortality. Asian and Pacific Islander children were disproportionally affected by Kawasaki Disease in the U.S ( 20.8 % of Kawasaki Disease admissions vs 3.3 % of all other pediatric hospital admissions, p < 0.01 ). Patients hospitalized for Kawasaki Disease had an increased risk of developing coronary artery aneurysms ( OR 2,839, 95 % CI 2,2985-3,527 ) and cardiogenic shock ( OR 3.42, 95 % CI 2.18-5.37 ). Patients with Kawasaki Disease were less likely to have congenital heart disease ( OR 0.62, 95 % CI 0.55-0.69 ), arrhythmia ( OR 0.31, 95 % CI 0.11-0.84 ), and acute respiratory distress syndrome ( OR 0.29, 95 % CI 0.19-0.43 ). Kawasaki Disease disease patients had shorter hospitalization length of stay by 2.59 days ( p < 0.01 ) and decreased cost of stay by $ 5,513 ( p < 0.01 ). Kawasaki Disease had lower mortality when compared to all other admissions ( OR 0.03, 95 % CI 0.01-0.09 ). No significant differences were found for ECMO, acute kidney injury, or liver failure. "
153704,Survival analysis of coronary care unit patients from MIMIC IV database: the role of potassium in cardiac patients,2022-05-01,"The profile of hospitalizations in coronary care units ( CCU ) includes patients with different age groups, multiple comorbidities and causes of hospitalization that may or may not be primarily cardiac. This study aimed to estimate survival time and evaluate the association and impact of different factors on this time in a cohort of patients admitted to CCU. A cohort of 7120 adult patients admitted to CCU was analyzed from a subset of data from the MIMIC-IV database ( Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, version 4 ). A descriptive analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, with a Log-rank test to establish comparisons between groups. Survival regression was modeled using Coxs proportional risk models for the multiple analysis. The p-value was defined as { inverted exclamation } 0.05 as statistically significant. In patients who died during hospitalization, there was a higher average age, longer hospital stay, and a higher rate of heart and respiratory rate, all with p { inverted exclamation } 0.00 Median overall survival was 28 days ( 95 % CI 26-30 days ). The survival probability curve presented a higher inclination in the first weeks, reaching a stable value close to 20 % at 10 weeks after hospitalization. When Coxs regression adjusted for age, gender and comorbidities was performed, hyperpotassemia was shown to be an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality ( RR = 22, 95 % CI14-30 ) in this group of patients. These results reinforced that the electronic health record may contain, already in the first hours of hospitalization, relevant information to understand the progression of diseases and identify future directions for research. This study is expected to clarify important topics related to the MIMIC-IV database and enable further research using the MIMIC-IV database. Knowledge of the characteristics of the CCU population can allow better management of physical and human hospital resources. "
153706,Effectiveness of ChAdOx1-S COVID-19 Booster Vaccination against the Omicron and Delta variants in England,2022-05-01,"Despite the potential widespread global use of the ChAdOx1-S booster, to date there are no published data on the real-world effectiveness. VE studies have found one and two doses of the ChAdOx1-S vaccine to be highly effective, and clinical trial data have demonstrated enhanced immunity following a ChAdOx1-S booster. In England, some individuals received a ChAdOx1-S booster where vaccination with mRNA vaccines was clinically contraindicated. The demographic characteristics of those who received the ChAdOx1-S booster against symptomatic disease and hospitalisation in England were compared to those who received a BNT162b2 booster. A test-negative case control design was used to estimate vaccine effectiveness of the ChAdOx1-S booster against symptomatic disease and hospitalisation in England. those who received a ChAdOx1-S booster were more likely to be female ( adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) 67 ( 64-71 ) ), in a clinical risk group ( adjusted OR 58 ( 54-63 ) ), in the CEV group ( adjusted OR 84 ( 79-89 ) ) or severely immunosuppressed ( adjusted OR 2.05 ( 96-2.13 ) ). Protection against symptomatic disease in those aged 65 years and older peaked at 66.1 % ( 16.6 to 86.3 % ) and 68.5 % ( 65.7 to 72 % ) amongst those who received the ChAdOx1-S and BNT162b2 booster vaccines, respectively. Protection waned to 44.5 % ( 22.4 to 60.2 % ) and 54.1 % ( 50.5 to 57.5 % ) after 5-9 weeks. Protection against hospitalisation following Omicron infection peaked at 82.3 % ( 64.2 to 93 % ) after receiving the ChAdOx1-S booster against symptomatic disease and hospitalisation in England, as compared to 90.9 % ( 88.7 to 92.7 % ) for those who received a BNT162b2 booster. Differences in the population boosted with ChAdOx1-S in England renders direct comparison of vaccine effectiveness by manufacturer challenging. Nonetheless, this study supports the use of the ChAdOx1-S booster for protection against severe disease with COVID-19 in settings that have not yet offered booster doses and suggests that those who received ChAdOx1-S as a booster in England do not require re-vaccination ahead of others.

153708,"Human behaviour, NPI and mobility reduction effects on COVID-19 transmission in different countries of the world",2022-05-01,"The outbreak of Coronavirus disease, which originated in Wuhan, China in 2019, has affected the lives of billions of people globally. Throughout 2020, the reproduction number of COVID-19 was widely used by decision-makers to explain decision-makers strategies to control the pandemic. In this work, Google deduce and analyze both initial and effective reproduction numbers for 12 diverse world regions between February and December of 2020. Google consider mobility reductions, mask wearing and compliance with masks, mask efficacy values alongside other non-pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) in each region to get further insights in how each of the above factored into each regions SARS-COV-2 transmission dynamic. Google quantify in each region the following reductions in the observed effective reproduction numbers of the pandemici ) reduction due to decrease in mobility ( as captured in Google mobility reports ) ii ) reduction due to mask wearing and mask complianceiii ) reduction due to other NPIs, over and above the ones identified in i ) and ii ). In most cases mobility reduction coming from nationwide lockdown measures has helped stave off the initial wave in countries who took these types of measures. Beyond the first waves, mask mandates and compliance, together with social-distancing measures ( which we refer to as other NPIs ) have allowed some control of subsequent disease spread. The methodology we propose here is novel and can be applied to other respiratory diseases such as influenza or RSV. "
153711,Pre-morbid use of proton pump inhibitors has no effect on the risk of death or hospitalization in COVID-19 patients: a matched cohort study,2022-05-01,"Several studies assessed the effect of pre-morbid exposure to proton pump inhibitors ( PPIs ) on disease course in adult COVID-19 patients with somewhat inconsistent results. This population-based matched cohort study embraced first COVID-19 episodes in adults diagnosed up to August 15 2021 in Croatia. Considering over-the-counter ( OTC ) availability of PPIs, patients were classified based on exposure to PPIs and burden of PPI-requiring conditions as non-users ( no issued prescriptions, no recorded treatment-requiring conditions between January 1 2019 and COVID-19 diagnosis ), possible users ( no issued prescriptions, recorded treatment-requiring conditionsOTC use possible ) and users ( different intensity of issued prescriptions over 12 months prior to diagnosis, at least one within 3 months ). Subsets were mutually exactly matched in respect to a range of pre-COVID-19 characteristics. The contrast between users and possible users was considered the most informative for the effect of PPIs that is separate of the effect of PPI-requiring conditions. Among 433609 COVID-19 patients, 332389 were PPI non-users, 18170 were possible users, and 55098 were users. Users and possible users were matched 41195 to 17334 and 33272 to 16434 in the primary and sensitivity analyses. There was no relevant difference between users and possible users regarding COVID -19-related mortality [ RR = 0.93 ( 95 % CI 0.85-02RD = -0.34 % (-0.73, 0.03 ) in primary and RR = 0.88 ( 0.78-0.98 ) RD =-0.45 (-0.80, -0.11 ) in sensitivity analysis ] or COVID -19-related hospitalizations [ RR = 04 ( 0.97-13 ) RD = 0.29 % (-0.16, 0.73 ) in primary and RR = 05 ( 0.97-15 ) RD = 0.32 % (-0.12, 0.75 ) in sensitivity analysis ]. Conclusions Pre-morbid exposure to PPIs does not affect the risk of death or hospitalization in adult COVID-19 patients. "

This study is a cross-sectional study of 2198 adult, COVID-19 survivors living in Bangladesh. Data were collected from previously diagnosed COVID-19 participants ( confirmed by an RT-PCR test ) via door-to-door interviews in the eight different divisions in Bangladesh. For data collection, Bengali translated Brief COPE inventory and WHO Brief Quality of Life ( WHO-QOLBREF ) questionnaires were used. The data collection period was from June 2020 to March 202 Males 72.38 % ( 1591 ) were more affected by COVID-19 than females 27.62 % ( 607 ). Age showed significant correlations ( p < 0.005 ) with physical, psychological and social relationshipswhereas, gender showed only significant correlation with physical health ( p < 0.001 ). Marital status, occupation, living area, and co-morbidities showed significant co-relation with all four domains of QoL ( p < 0.001 ). Education and affected family members showed significant correlation with physical and social relationship ( p < 0.001 ). However, smoking habit showed significant correlations with both social relationship and environment ( p < 0.001 ). Age and marital status showed a significant correlation with the predominant coping strategy ( p < 0.001 ) whereas gender and co-morbidities showed significant correlation with problem focused coping strategies ( p < 0.001 ). Educational qualification, occupation and living area showed significant correlation with all three coping strategies ( p < 0.001 ). Survivors of COVID-19 showed mixed types of coping strategieshowever, the predominant coping strategy was avoidant coping, followed by problem focused coping, with emotion focused coping reported as the least prevalent. Marital status, occupation, living area and co-morbidities showed a greater effect on QoL in all participants. This study represents the real scenario of nationwide health associated quality of life and coping strategy during and beyond the Delta pandemic. "
153715,"In schizophrenia, the effects of the IL-6/IL-23/Th17 axis on health-related quality of life and disabilities are partly mediated by generalized cognitive decline and the symptomatome.",2022-05-01,"Schizophrenia patients show increased disabilities and lower quality of life ( DisQoL ). Nevertheless, there are no data whether, in schizophrenia, activation of the interleukin ( IL )-6, IL-23, T helper ( Th )-17 axis and lowered magnesium and calcium levels impact DisQoL scores. This study recruited 90 patients with schizophrenia ( including 40 with deficit schizophrenia ) and 40 healthy controls and assessed the World Health Association QoL instrument-Abbreviated version and Sheehan Disability scale, Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia ( BACS ), IL-6, IL-23, IL-17, IL-21, IL-22, tumor necrosis factor ( TNF )-, magnesium and calcium. Regression analyses showed that a large part of the first factor extracted from the physical, psychological, social and environmental HR-QoL and interference with school / work, social life, and home responsibilities was predicted by a generalized cognitive deterioration ( G-CoDe ) index ( a latent vector extracted from BACs scores ), and the first vector extracted from various symptom domains ( symptomatome ), whereas the biomarkers had no effects. Partial Least Squares analysis showed that the interleukin ( IL )-6, IL-23, T helper ( Th )-17 axis and magnesium / calcium had highly significant total ( indirect + direct ) effects on HR-QoL / disabilities which were mediated by G-CoDe and the symptomatome ( a first factor extracted from negative and positive symptoms ). the interleukin ( IL )-6, IL-23, T helper ( Th )-17 axis explained 63.1 % of the variance in a single latent trait extracted from G-CoDe, symptomatome, HR-QoL and disability data. The latter features are manifestations of a common core, namely the behavioral-cognitive-psycho-social worsening index, which is caused by the neuroimmunotoxic effects of the interleukin ( IL )-6, IL-23, T helper ( Th )-17 axis in subjects with lowered antioxidant defenses ( magnesium and calcium ) thereby producing damage to neuronal circuits underpinning deficit schizophrenia.

153712,Clinicopathological and Imaging Features of Primary Biliary Cholangitis,2022-05-01,"Primary biliary cholangitis ( PBC ) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease of the biliary epithelial cells, causing slow progression of cholestasis and fibrosis. The aim of the study is to summarize the imaging features of PBC and examine the correlation between PBC clinicopathological and radiologic features, elucidating the specific clinicopathological and radiologic differences between male and female PBC patients, as well as between AMA-positive and AMA-negative PBC patients. Demographic, laboratory, radiologic and survival data were collected retrospectively for patients diagnosed and treated for PBC at the Mount Sinai Health System between 2016 and 2020 with at least one ultrasound, CT, or MRI of abdomen available for assessment. Biochemical and radiologic data were compared between male v.s. female groups, and AMA-positive v.s. AMA-negative group. Results A total of 273 patients diagnosed with PBC were included. Non-specific hepatic parenchymal disease, cirrhosis, cholelithiasis, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, benign liver masses / cysts were the most common features on abdominal images. 24 % of PBC patients had biliary tree abnormalities on MRI. LAD was reported in 38-47 % of PBC. There was no significant difference in age, race, or ethnicity between the sexes of patients with PBC, however imaging characteristics of portal hypertension were more frequently seen in men. AMA-negative PBC patients had similar distributions of age, race / ethnicity and survival to AMA-positive PBC patients. PBC summarized the clinicopathological and imaging features of PBC and distinct subgroups. the study would assist in the diagnosis of PBC and avoid over-testing in real-world practice. "

153716,Categorical and dimensional brain network-based models of trauma-related dissociative subtypes,2022-05-01,"Trauma-related pathological dissociation is a multidimensional and disabling phenomenon that involves disruptions or discontinuities in psychological functioning. Despite its prevalence, personal and societal burden, dissociation remains underappreciated in clinical practice, and dissociation lacks a synthesized neurobiological model that could place dissociation in context with other common psychiatric symptoms. To identify a nuanced neurobiological model of pathological dissociation, we examined the functional connectivity of three core neurocognitive networks as related to the dimensional dissociation subtypes of depersonalization / derealization and partially-dissociated intrusions, and the diagnostic category of a complex dissociation disorder, dissociative identity disorder ( DID ). Participants were 91 adult women with and withouta history of childhood trauma, current posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) and varied levels of pathological dissociation. Participants provided interview and self-report data about pathological dissociation, PTSD symptoms, childhood maltreatment history, and completed a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. After controlling for age, childhood maltreatment and PTSD symptom severity, we found that pathological dissociation was associated with hyperconnectivity within central executive, default, and salience networks, and decreased connectivity of central executive and salience networks with other areas. Moreover, we isolated unique connectivity markers linked to depersonalization / derealization, to partially-dissociated intrusions, and to DID. we work suggests subtypes of pathological dissociation have robust, discernable, and unique functional connectivity signatures. The neural correlates of dissociation may serve as potential targets for treatment engagement to facilitate recovery from PTSD and pathological dissociation. These results underscore dissociation assessment as crucial in clinical and medical care settings. "
153718,"How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect access to condoms, chlamydia and HIV testing, and cervical cancer screening at a population level in Britain? (Natsal-COVID)",2022-05-01,"To investigate how differential access to key interventions to reduce sexually transmitted infections ( STI ), HIV, and HIV sequelae changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. British participants ( 18-59y ) completed a cross-sectional web survey one year ( March to April 2021 ) after the initial lockdown in Britain. Quota-based sampling and weighting resulted in a quasi-representative population sample. We compared Natsal-COVID data with Natsal-3, a household-based probability sample cross-sectional survey ( 16-74y ) conducted in 2010-12. Reported unmet need for condoms because of the pandemic and uptake of chlamydia testing / HIV testing / cervical cancer screening were analysed among sexually-experienced participants ( 18-44y ) ( n = 2869, Natsal-COVIDn = 8551, Natsal-3 ). Odds ratios adjusted for age ( aOR ) and other potential confounders ( AOR ) describe associations with demographic and behavioural factors. In 2021, 6.9 % of women and 16.2 % of men reported unmet need for condoms because of the pandemic. This was more likely among participantsaged 18-24 years, of Black or Black British ethnicity, and reporting same-sex sex ( past five years ) or one or more new relationships ( past year ). Chlamydia and HIV testing were more commonly reported by younger participants, those reporting condomless sex with new sexual partners, and men reporting same-sex partnersa very similar distribution to 10 years previously ( Natsal-3 ). However, there were differences during the COVID-19 pandemic, including stronger associations with chlamydia testing for men reporting same-sex partnerswith HIV testing for women reporting new sexual partnersand with cervical screening among smokers. Our study suggests differential access to key primary and secondary STI / HIV prevention interventions continued during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the available evidence does not suggest substantial changes in inequalities in since 2010-12. While the COVID-19 pandemic might not have exacerbated inequalities in access to primary and secondary prevention, the COVID-19 pandemic is clear that large inequalities persisted, typically among those at greatest STI / HIV risk. Key MessagesMany MSM, people of Black ethnicity and young people ( i.e. groups most impacted by STIs ) reported unmet need for condoms because of the pandemic Our compared inequalities in access to key interventions using Natsal-COVID ( 2021 ) and Natsal-3 ( 2010-12 ). During the pandemic ( Natsal-COVID ), there were stronger associations with chlamydia testing for MSM and with HIV testing for women reporting new sexual partners. There were stronger associations with cervical screening among smokers during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2010-12 ( Natsal-3 ). However, Our did not find strong evidence that vulnerable groups were at additional risk during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared to 2010-12. "
153717,Quantifying the relationship between sub-population wastewater samples and community-wide SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence,2022-05-01,"Wastewater-based epidemiology is a promising approach but robust epidemiological models to relate wastewater to community prevalence are lacking. Assessments of SARS-CoV-2 infection rates have relied primarily on convenience sampling, which does not provide reliable estimates of community prevalence because of inherent biases. From August 2020 to February 2021, we conducted a serial stratified randomized samplings to estimate the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 3,717 participants, and weekly sampling of community wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in Jefferson County, KY. With the use of a Susceptible, Infected, Recovered ( SIR )-type model, we obtained longitudinal estimates of prevalence and compared these with wastewater concentration, using regression analysis. Model analysis revealed significant temporal differences in epidemic peaksthe average incidence rate based on serological sampling in some areas was up to 50 % higher than health department rates based on convenience sampling. The model-estimated average prevalence rates correlated well with wastewater ( correlation = 0 { middle dot } 63 ). In regression analysis, a weekly unit increase in wastewater concentration of SARS-CoV-2 corresponded to an average increase of between 1-1 { middle dot } 3 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection per 100K residents. Publicly available health department incidence rates vastly underestimate true community incidence and wastewater has a high potential to provide robust estimates of community spread of infection. Research in context Administratively reported clinical case rates of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) infected individuals are biased due to a wide range of factors from testing access to concerns about missing low and non-symptomatic and self-tested individuals. Wastewater estimates offer an alternative to support community monitoring based on fecal shedding of the virus but are difficult to interpret when compared with the available public health data sets of infection rates. We examined all English literature until February 24, 2022, on Web of Science and PubMed with the terms [ seroprevalence or antibody ] AND [ COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 ] AND [ wastewater ]. We identified six studies. None of six studies considered randomized COVID-19 community anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing paired with wastewater data. Added value of this study this study demonstrates how results from serial stratified randomized serological sampling of the community can be used to build a longitudinal model that can interpolate and extrapolate community levels of infection beyond specific testing dates. Such a model correlates well with wastewater concentrations indicating Such a model utility as a surrogate for infection prevalence. The testing data used in this study were collected before wide availability of COVID-19 vaccines and are therefore unique as The testing data are unlikely to include a significant number of false positive results. this study demonstrates that convenience sampling obtained data from health department reporting seriously underestimates community-wide prevalence of infection. In contrast, Wastewater-based epidemiology may be a faster, cost-effective, and more robust method of estimating the prevalence of viral infections within specific urban areas. "
153719,Genetic Risk Factors for Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation - a Nationwide Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS),2022-05-01,"Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is a major cause of morbidity with a high prevalence among the elderly and has an established genetic disposition. Surgery is a well-known risk factor for AFhowever, it is currently not recognized how much common genetic variants influence the postoperative risk. The purpose of this study was to identify Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms associated with postoperative AF. The UK Biobank was utilized to conduct a Genome-Wide Association Study ( GWAS ) to identify variants associated with AF after surgery. An initial discovery GWAS was performed in patients that had undergone surgery with subsequent replication in a unique non-surgical cohort. In a unique non-surgical cohort, cases were defined as newly diagnosed AF within 30 days after surgery. The threshold for significance was set at 5 x 10-8. After quality control, 144,196 surgical patients with 254,068 SNPs were left for analysis. Two variants ( rs17042171 ( p = 4.86 x 10-15 ) and rs17042081 ( p = 7.12 x 10-15 ) ) near the PITX2-gene reached statistical significance. Two variants ( rs17042171 ( p = 4.86 x 10-15 ) and rs17042081 ( p = 7.12 x 10-15 ) ) near the PITX2-gene were replicated in a unique non-surgical cohort ( 39 x 10-101 and 27 x 10-93, respectively ). Several other loci were significantly associated with AF in a unique non-surgical cohort. In this GWAS-analysis of a large national biobank, we identified 2 variants that were significantly associated with postoperative AF. Two variants ( rs17042171 ( p = 4.86 x 10-15 ) and rs17042081 ( p = 7.12 x 10-15 ) ) near the PITX2-gene were subsequently replicated in a unique non-surgical cohort. These findings bring new insight in the genetics of postoperative AF and may help identify at-risk patients and guide management. "
153720,Immune responses following 3rd and 4th doses of heterologous and homologous COVID-19 vaccines in kidney transplant recipients,2022-05-01,"Solid organ transplant recipients have attenuated immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. In this study, we report on immune responses to 3rd-( V3 ) and 4th-( V4 ) doses of heterologous and homologous vaccines in a kidney transplant population. 724 kidney transplant recipients were prospectively screened for serological responses following 3 primary doses of a SARS-CoV2 vaccine. 322 patients were sampled post-V4 for anti-spike ( anti-S ), with 69 undergoing assessment of SARS-CoV-2 T-cell responses. All vaccine doses were received post-transplant, only mRNA vaccines were used for V3 and V4 dosing. All participants had serological testing performed post-V2 and at least once prior to All participants 1st dose of vaccine. Results586 / 724 ( 80.9 % ) patients were infection-naive post-V3141 / 2586 ( 24.1 % ) remained seronegative at 31 ( 21-51 ) days post-V3. Timing of vaccination in relation to transplantation, OR0 .28 ( 0.15-0.54 ), p = 0.0001 immunosuppression burden, OR0 .22 ( 0.13-0.37 ), p < 0.0001, and a diagnosis of diabetes, OR0 .49 ( 0.32-0.75 ), p = 0.001, remained independent risk factors for non-seroconversion. Seropositive patients post-V3 had greater anti-S if primed with BNT162b2 compared with ChAdOx1, p = 0.00 Post-V4, 45/239 ( 18.8 % ) infection-naive patients remained seronegative. De novo seroconversion post-V4 occurred in 15/60 ( 25.0 % ) patients who were seronegative post-V3. There was no difference in anti-S post-V4 by vaccine combination, p = 0.50. Anti-S post-V4 were sequentially greater in those seroconverting post V2-compared with V3-, and V3-compared with V4-, at 1561 ( 567-5211 ), 379 ( 101-851 ) and 19 ( 9.7-48 ) BAU / ml respectively. T-cell responses were poor, with only 11/54 ( 20.4 % ) infection-naive patients having detectable T-cell responses post-V4, with no difference seen by vaccine type. Conclusion A significant proportion of transplant recipients remain seronegative following 3-and 4-doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, with poor T-cell responses, and are likely to have inadequate protection against infection.

153721,Predicting longitudinal brain atrophy in Parkinson's disease using a Susceptible-Infected-Removed agent-based model,2022-05-01,"Parkinsons disease ( PD ) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by accumulation of abnormal isoforms of alpha-synuclein. alpha-synuclein is proposed to act as a prion in PDin alpha-synuclein misfolded pathologic state alpha-synuclein favours the misfolding of normal alpha-synuclein molecules, spreads trans-neuronally, and causes neuronal or synaptic damage as alpha-synuclein accumulates. alpha-synuclein remains controversial. We have previously developed a Susceptible-Infected-Removed ( SIR ) computational model that simulates the templating, propagation and toxicity of alpha-synuclein molecules in the brain. Here We test a Susceptible-Infected-Removed ( SIR ) computational model that simulates the templating, propagation and toxicity of alpha-synuclein molecules in the brain with longitudinal MRI collected over four years from the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative ( 1068 T1 MRI scans, 790 PD, 278 matched controls ). We find that brain deformation progresses in subcortical and cortical regions. The SIR model, using structural connectivity from diffusion MRI, recapitulates the spatiotemporal distribution of brain atrophy observed in PD. We show that connectome topology and geometry significantly contribute to model fit. We also show that the spatial expression of two genes implicated in alpha-synuclein synthesis and clearance, SNCA and GBA, also influences the atrophy pattern. We conclude that the progression of atrophy in PD is consistent with the prion-like hypothesis and that a Susceptible-Infected-Removed ( SIR ) computational model that simulates the templating, propagation and toxicity of alpha-synuclein molecules in the brain is a promising tool to investigate multifactorial neurodegenerative diseases over time.

153722,Death by Round Numbers and Sharp Thresholds: How to Avoid Dangerous AI EHR Recommendations,2022-05-01,"Recommendations for clinical practice consider consistency of application and ease of implementation, resulting in treatment decisions that use round numbers and sharp thresholds even though these choices produce statistically sub-optimal decisions. To characterize the impact of these choices, we examine four datasets and the biases underlying patient mortality risk. we document two types of suboptimalities ( 1 ) discontinuities in which treatment decisions produce step-function changes in risk near clinically-important round-number cutoffs, and ( 2 ) counter-causal paradoxes in which anti-correlation between risk factors and aggressive treatment produces risk curves that contradict underlying causal risk. we also show that outcomes have improved over decades of refinement of clinical practice, reducing but not eliminating the strength of and the biases underlying patient mortality risk. Finally, we provide recommendations for clinical practice and data analysisinterpretable glass-box models can transform the challenges of statistical confounding into opportunities to improve medical practice.

153723,A comprehensive accuracy assessment of Samsung smartwatch heart rate and heart rate variability,2022-05-01,"Photoplethysmography ( PPG ) is a low-cost and easy-to-implement method to measure vital signs, including heart rate ( HR ) and heart rate variability ( HRV ). The method is widely used in various wearable devices. For example, Samsung smartwatches are PPG-based open-source wristbands used in remote well-being monitoring and fitness applications. However, PPG is highly susceptible to motion artifacts and environmental noise. A validation study is required to investigate the accuracy of PPG-based wearable devices in free-living conditions. PPG evaluate the accuracy of PPG signals-collected by the Samsung Gear Sport smartwatch in free-living conditions-in terms of HR and time-domain and frequency-domain HRV parameters against a medical-grade chest electrocardiogram ( ECG ) monitor. PPG conducted 24-hours monitoring using a Samsung Gear Sport smartwatch and a Shimmer3 ECG device. 24-hours monitoring using a Samsung Gear Sport smartwatch and a Shimmer3 ECG device included 28 participants ( 14 male and 14 female ), where they engaged in they daily routines. PPG evaluated HR and HRV parameters during the sleep and awake time. HR and HRV parameters extracted from the smartwatch were compared against the ECG reference. For the comparison, PPG employed the Pearson correlation coefficient, Bland-Altman plot, and linear regression methods. PPG found a significantly high positive correlation between the smartwatchs and Shimmer ECGs HR, time-domain HRV, LF, and PPG and a significant moderate positive correlation between the smartwatchs and shimmer ECGs LF / PPG during sleep time. The mean biases of HR, time-domain HRV, and LF / HF were low, while The mean biases of HR, time-domain HRV, and LF / HF LF PPG were moderate during sleep. The regression analysis showed low error variances of HR, AVNN, and pNN50, moderate error variances of SDNN, RMSSD, LF, and HF, and high error variances of LF / HF during sleep. During the awake time, there was a significantly high positive correlation of AVNN and a moderate positive correlation of HR, while HR and HRV parameters indicated significantly low positive correlations. RMSSD and SDNN showed low mean biases, and HR and HRV parameters had moderate mean biases. In addition, AVNN had moderate error variance while HR and HRV parameters indicated high error variances. The Samsung smartwatch provides acceptable HR, time-domain HRV, LF, and HF parameters during sleep time. In contrast, during the awake time, AVNN and HR show satisfactory accuracy, and HR and HRV parameters have high errors. "
153725,A methodology to generate epidemic scenarios for emerging infectious diseases based on the use of key calendar events,2022-05-01,"This work presents a methodology to recreate the observed dynamics of emerging infectious diseases and to generate short-term forecasts for their evolution based on superspreading events occurring on key calendar dates. The method is illustrated by the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics in Mexico and Peru up to January 31, 2022. We also produce scenarios obtained through the estimation of a time-dependent contact rate, with the main assumption that the dynamic of the disease is determined by the mobility and social activity of the population during holidays and other important calendar dates. First, historical changes in the effective contact rate on predetermined dates are estimated. Then, this information is used to forecast scenarios under the assumption that the trends of the effective contact rate on predetermined dates observed in the past will be similar on the same but future key calendar dates. All other conditions are assumed to remain constant in the time scale of the projections. One of the main features of a methodology is that a methodology avoids the necessity of fixing values of the dynamic parameters for the whole prediction period. Results show that considering the key dates as reference information is useful to recreate the different outbreaks, slow or fast-growing, that an epidemic can present and, in most cases, make good short-term predictions.

The hypothetical situation uses a vial with a similar size as the ChAdox1-n CoV vial. we used distilled water ( 6.5 ml ), to fill the vaccine volume as five vials of ChAdox1-n CoV. When 0.48 ml of the distilled water is drawn according to the number on the side of the barrel, an additional 0.10 ml of air can be used in the dead space of the distilled water in a syringe and needle for 60 doses, which can be divided into an average of 0.5 ml dose. ChAdox1-n CoV was administered using a 1-mL syringe and 25G needle to administer ChAdox1-n CoV vaccine into 12 doses using the air-filled technique. the vaccine volume will be increase by 20 % and save the budget of a low dead space syringe ( LDS ).

153724,"An intermediate step in bridging the gap between evidence and practice: developing and applying a methodology for ""general good practices""",2022-05-01,"The gap between evidence and clinical practice has been in the focus of researches for decades. Although successful implementation means the new knowledge must work in particular environments, the new knowledge does nt mean that the entire process should exclusively be executed by the individual institutes. the new knowledge is the point where we assumed that an intermediate step, the general good practice, could help to ensure that translation is done in a more professional way. The development of the general good practice methodology was based on we infinitE model, which organized the factors of successful translation into an evidence-editing-embedding-effect on practice framework, using tools from the disciplines of Evidence-Based Medicine, Quality Improvement and Change Management. the general good practice methodology organised the editing and embedding part of The development of the general good practice methodology into a process involving three full-day sessions carried out with different health professionals, experts and moderators. After pilot testing, the general good practice methodology was finalized and applied to other topics as well. the general good practice methodology presented in detail in this paper, centred on flow chart, process analysis, failure mode identification and Kotters 8-step model. Beside the pilot topic of the institutional process of resuscitation, the general good practice methodology has also proved applicable to more than ten other topics, meaning that at least all the core elements of the proposed bundle of general good practice have been produced in the development process. Compared to the guidelines, general good practices demonstrate the evidence in operation, helping to develop workflows, responsibilities, documentation, trainings, etc. and can also be a starting point for the digitalisation of care processes. The next step is to examine how healthcare institutions can build on these in healthcare institutions own editing and embedding activities, and what the results will be. Further studies could explore the applicability of the general good practice methodology in different healthcare systems or at different levels of maturity in terms of quality. "
153727,A machine learning based predictive model for the diagnosis of sepsis,2022-05-01,"The early recognition and treatment of sepsis is essential to increase the probability of survival of the patient. sepsis is a complex and heterogeneous syndrome influenced by the site of infection, causative microorganisms, acute organ dysfunctions and co-morbidities. So, early diagnosis is a challenge in which complex physiologic, metabolic, biochemical markers and clinical signs must be evaluated simultaneously for a reliable and early identification of sepsis. In this paper, a list of relevant variables involved in sepsis diagnosis is provided. Furthermore, to help answering the question of whether a patient is suffering from sepsis when entering the emergency room, a model based on the machine learning gradient boosting algorithm is proposed. Using three histones H2B, H3, H4 and the activated protein C together with other variables a gradient boosting classifier was trained and evaluated with cross validation. Results show that a model based on the machine learning gradient boosting algorithm can achieve up to a 97 % mean per-class accuracy. "

Two new sub-lineages, BA .4 and BA .5, are now emerging in South Africa with changes relative to BA .1, including L452R and F486V mutations in the spike receptor binding domain. We isolated live BA .4 and BA .5 viruses and tested live BA .4 and BA .5 viruses against neutralizing immunity elicited to BA .1 infection in participants who were Omicron / BA .1 infected but unvaccinated ( n = 24 ) and participants vaccinated with Pfizer BNT162b2 or Johnson and Johnson Ad26.CoV .2 S with breakthrough Omicron / BA .1 infection ( n = 15 ). In unvaccinated individuals, FRNT50, the inverse of the dilution for 50 % neutralization, declined from 275 for BA .1 to 36 for BA .4 and 37 for BA .5, a 7.6 and 7.5-fold drop, respectively. In vaccinated BA .1 breakthroughs, FRNT50 declined from 507 for BA .1 to 158 for BA .4 ( 3.2-fold ) and 198 for BA .5 ( 2.6-fold ). Absolute BA .4 and BA .5 neutralization levels were about 5-fold higher in this group versus unvaccinated BA .1 infected participants. The observed escape of BA .4 and BA .5 from BA .1 elicited immunity is more moderate than of BA .1 against previous immunity1 ,3. However, the low absolute neutralization levels for BA .4 and BA .5, particularly in the unvaccinated group, are unlikely to protect well against symptomatic infection4.This may indicate that, based on neutralization escape, BA .4 and BA .5 have potential to result in a new infection wave.

The circumstances of the present pandemic facilitated a unique opportunity to fully examine this provocative idea. The data we show provides evidence for a new mechanism by which herd immunity may be manifested, the aerosol transfer of antibodies between immune and non-immune hosts. "
153735,"Epidemiological and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in children during the outbreak of Omicron Variant in Shanghai, March 7-March 31, 2022",2022-05-02,"To understand the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection during the early stage of Omicron variant outbreak in Shanghai. This study included local COVID-19 cases < 18 years in Shanghai referred to the exclusively designated hospital by the end of March 2022 since emergence of Omicron epidemic. Clinical data, epidemiological exposure and COVID-19 vaccination status were collected. Relative risks ( RR ) were calculated to assess the effect of vaccination on symptomatic infection and febrile disease. Results A total of 376 pediatric cases of COVID-19 ( median age : 6.0 { + /-} 4.2 years ) were referred to the designated hospital during the period of March 7-31, including 257 ( 68.4 % ) symptomatic cases and 119 ( 36 % ) asymptomatic cases. the 307 ( 86 % ) children ; 3 years eligible for COVID-19 vaccination, 110 ( 40.4 % ) received 2-dose vaccines and 16 ( 4.0 % ) received 1-dose vaccine. The median interval between 2-dose vaccination and infection was 3.5 ( IQR3, 4.5 ) months ( 16 days-7 months ). Two-dose COVID-19 vaccination reduced the risks of symptomatic infection and febrile disease by 35 % ( RR 0.65, 95 % CI : 0.53-0.79 ) and 33 % ( RR 0.64, 95 % CI0.51-0.81 ). Two hundred and sixteen ( 83.4 % ) symptomatic cases had fever ( mean duration7 { + /-} 0.8 days ), 104 ( 40.2 % ) had cough, 16.4 % had transient leukopenia307 ( 86 % ) had an epidemiological exposure in household ( 69.1 % ), school ( 28 % ) and residential area ( 8.8 % ). The surge of pediatric COVID-19 cases and multiple transmission model reflect wide dissemination of Omicron variant in the community. Asymptomatic infection is common among Omicron-infected children. COVID-19 vaccination can offer protection against symptomatic infection and febrile disease. "
153736,"Outcomes of convalescent plasma with defined high- versus lower-neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 among hospitalized patients: CoronaVirus Inactivating Plasma (CoVIP), double-blind phase 2 study.",2022-05-02,"COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma ( that very low antibody-content CCP ) was an early and widely adopted putative therapy for severe COVID-19. Results from randomized control trials and observational studies have failed to demonstrate a clear therapeutic role for that very low antibody-content CCP for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Underlying these inconclusive findings is a broad heterogeneity in the concentrations of neutralizing antibodies ( nAb ) between different that very low antibody-content CCP donors. The present study was designed to evaluate n Ab titer threshold for that very low antibody-content CCP. n Ab titer-defined CCP conducted a double-blind, phase 2 study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of n Ab titer-defined CCP in adults admitted to an academic referral hospital. Patients positive on a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test and with symptoms for < 10 days were eligible. Participants received either that very low antibody-content CCP with n Ab titers 1:160-1:640 ( standard titer group ) or > 1:640 ( high titer group ) in addition to standard of care treatments. Adverse events were contrasted by that very low antibody-content CCP titer. The primary clinical outcome was time to hospital discharge, with mortality and respiratory support evaluated as secondary outcomes. Between August 28 and December 4, 2020, 316 participants were screened, 55 received CCP, with 41 and 14 receiving standard versus high titer CCP, respectively. Participants were a median of 61 years of age ( IQR 52-67 ), 36 % women, 25 % Black and 33 % Hispanic. Severe adverse events ( SAE ) ( grade 3 ) occurred in 4 ( 29 % ) and 23 ( 56 % ) of participants in the high versus standard titer groups, respectively by day 28 ( Risk Difference -0.28 [ 95 % CI -0.56, 0.01 ] ). There were no observed treatment-related AEs. By day 55, time to hospital discharge was shorter among participants receiving high versus standard titer, accounting for death as a competing event ( hazard ratio 94 [ 95 % CI 05, 3.58 ], Grays p = 0.02 ). In this phase 2 trial in a high-risk population of patients admitted for Covid-19, lower n Ab titer CCP found earlier time to hospital discharge and lower occurrences of life-threatening SAEs among participants receiving that very low antibody-content CCP with n Ab titers > 1:640 compared with participants receiving that very low antibody-content CCP with lower n Ab titer CCP. Though limited by a small study size these inconclusive findings support further study of high-nAb titer CCP defined as > 1:640 in the treatment of COVID-19. The present study was supported by the UNC Health Foundation and the North Carolina Policy Collaboratory at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with funding from the North Carolina Coronavirus Relief Fund established and appropriated by the North Carolina General Assembly. The laboratory assays for neutralizing antibody titers and SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody-binding assays were partially supported by The NIH NCI / NIAID SeroNet Serocenter of Excellence Award U54 CA260543. Research in ContextCOVID-19 Convalescent Plasma ( that very low antibody-content CCP ) has emergency use authorization from the FDA for early treatment of COVID-19 in either outpatient or inpatient settings. Evidence supporting the use of that very low antibody-content CCP for severe COVID-19 is mixed and still emerging. One major limitation in interpreting published clinical trials and the clinical role of that very low antibody-content CCP is incomplete understanding of necessary neutralizing antibody ( nAb ) titer for that very low antibody-content CCP. Observational studies suggest that that very low antibody-content CCP is more effective than lower antibody-content CCP, or that very low antibody-content CCP is harmful. We searched PubMed articles published between February 1, 2020, and April 15, 2022, using the terms COVID-19, convalescent plasma, SARS-CoV-2, and that very low antibody-content CCP alone and in combination. We search yielded 6,468 results which We filtered to 280 and 162 by selecting Clinical Trial and Randomized Controlled Trial article types, respectively. Among these, We identified 25 open-label or blinded efficacy or effectiveness studies in hospitalized patients that were relevant to We study. Preliminary reports show wide variability in the antibody content of that very low antibody-content CCP used in clinical trials, the assays used to define that very low antibody-content CCP antibody content, and the estimates of clinical outcomes following that very low antibody-content CCP therapy for hospitalized patients. Only one study deliberately infused that very low antibody-content CCP with n Ab > 1:640. Post-hoc analyses of potent monoclonal antibody therapy in hospitalized patients in the UK showed survival benefit when monoclonal antibody was infused to patients who had not yet seroconverted by spike antibody ELISA, suggesting that if dosed appropriately, antibody-based therapies may have a role in improving outcomes of severe COVID-19. Added value of The present study This phase 2 study showed that CCP with high n Ab titer ( > 1:640 ) provided more rapid recovery to hospital discharge and fewer COVID-19 attributable AEs than that very low antibody-content CCP with n Ab titer between the FDA-recommended minimum standard and 4-fold higher ( 1:160-1:640 ). The hazard ratio of time to hospital discharge from baseline through day 55, accounting for death as a competing event, contrasting patients receiving high versus standard that very low antibody-content CCP titer was 94 ( 95 % CI 05-3.58 ). Adjusted hazard ratios of high versus standard titer CCP receipt for time to hospital discharge were consistent with the primary unadjusted findings. Mortality through 55 days was lower in the high titer group, but with a wide confidence interval that did not reach statistical significance. Our data that CCP with n Ab > 1:640 expedites recovery of patients admitted with COVID-19 compared with that very low antibody-content CCP with n Ab > 1:640-1:640 suggests that a threshhold of n Ab > 1:640 may be too low to define that very low antibody-content CCP as high titer. Analyses in larger that very low antibody-content CCP trials should consider full reporting of n Ab in that very low antibody-content CCP units administered at individual study participant level, and specifically whether that very low antibody-content CCP contained n Ab > 1:640. Further investigation of that very low antibody-content CCP with n Ab > 1:640 is warranted given that raising a threshhold of n Ab 1:160, or a correlative specific anti-spike antibody assay, used to qualify high titer CCP in clinical trials could inform policy guidance and clinical use of that very low antibody-content CCP.

153737,Immunogenicity and safety of the CoronaVac inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in people with underlying medical conditions: a retrospective study,2022-05-02,"People living with chronic disease, particularly seniors older than 60 years old, are lagging behind in the national vaccination campaign in China due to uncertainty of safety and effectiveness. However, this special population made up of most severe symptom and death cases among infected patients and should be prioritized in vaccination program. In this retrospective study, we assessed the safety and immunogenicity of the CoronaVac inactivated vaccines in people with underlying medical conditions to address the vaccine hesitation in this special population. In this retrospective study, volunteers aged 40 years and older, had received two doses of the CoronaVac inactivated vaccines ( 3-5 weeks interval ), been healthy or with at least one of the six diseasescoronary heart disease ( CAD ), hypertension, diabetes mellitus ( DM ), chronic respiratory disease ( CRD ), obesity and cancer, were recruited from 4 study sites in China. The primary safety outcome was the incidence of adverse events within 14 days after each dose of vaccination. The primary safety outcome was geometric mean titer ( GMT ) of neutralizing antibodies to living SARS-CoV-2 virus at 14-28 days, 3 months, and 6 months after full two-dose vaccination. this retrospective study is registered with ChiCTR.org.cn ( ChiCTR2200058281 ) and is active but no longer recruiting. Among 1,302 volunteers screened between Jul 5 and Dec 30, 2021, 969 were eligible and enrolled in our cohort, including 740 living with underlying medical conditions and 229 as healthy control. All of them formed the safety cohort. The overall incidence of adverse reactions was 150 ( 20.27 % ) of 740 in the comorbidities group versus 32 ( 13.97 % ) of 229 in the comorbidities group, with significant difference ( P = 0.0334 ). significant difference was mainly contributed by fatigue and injection-site pain in some groups. Most adverse reactions were mild ( Grade 1 ). We did not observe any serious adverse events related to vaccination. By day 14-28 post vaccination, the seroconversion rates and GMT of neutralizing antibody showed no significant difference between disease group and healthy group, except CAD group ( P = 0.03 ) and CRD group ( P = 0.04 ) showed slight reduction. By day 90, the neutralizing antibody GMTs were significantly reduced in each group, with no significant difference between diseases and healthy group. By day 180, the neutralizing antibody GMTs continued to decrease in each group, but with slower declination. For people living with chronic disease especially seniors older than 60 years, the CoronaVac vaccines are as safe as in healthy people. Although and immunogenicity is slightly different in subgroup of some diseases compared with that of this special population, the overall trend was consistent. We findings highlight the evidence to address vaccine hesitancy for seniors and people living with chronic diseases.

153729,Association between Intraoperative End-Tidal Carbon Dioxide and Postoperative Organ Dysfunction in Major Abdominal Surgery: A Retrospective Cohort Study,2022-05-01,"Data on the effects of intraoperative end-tidal carbon dioxide ( EtCO2 ) levels on postoperative organ dysfunction are limited. Thus, this study was designed to investigate the relationship between the intraoperative EtCO2 level and postoperative organ dysfunction in patients who underwent major abdominal surgery under general anesthesia. Kyoto University Hospital conducted a retrospective cohort study involving patients who underwent major abdominal surgery under general anesthesia at Kyoto University Hospital. Kyoto University Hospital classified those with a mean EtCO2 of less than 35 mm Hg as low EtCO2. The time effect was determined as the minutes when the EtCO2 value was below 35 mmHg, whereas The time effect was evaluated by measuring the area below the 35-mmHg threshold. The outcome was postoperative organ dysfunction, defined as a composite of at least one organ dysfunction among acute renal injury, circulatory dysfunction, respiratory dysfunction, coagulation dysfunction, and liver dysfunction within 7 days after surgery. the 4,171 patients, 1,195 ( 28 % ) had low EtCO2, and 1,428 ( 34 % ) had postoperative organ dysfunction. An association was found between low EtCO2 and increased postoperative organ dysfunction ( adjusted risk ratio, 1195 % confidence interval [ CI ], 03-20p = 0.006 ). Additionally, long-term exposure to EtCO2 values of less than 35 mm Hg ( 224 min ) was associated with postoperative organ dysfunction ( adjusted risk ratio, 1895 % CI, 06-32p = 0.003 ) and low EtCO2 severity ( area under the 35-mmHg threshold ) ( adjusted risk ratio, 1395 % CI, 02-26p = 0.018 ). Intraoperative low EtCO2 of below 35 mm Hg was associated with increased postoperative organ dysfunction. "
153730,PREVALENCE OF PRECONCEPTION CARE PROVISION IN KISUMU COUNTY-KENYA,2022-05-01,"Preconception care ( PCC ) is the provision of biomedical, behavioral and social health interventions to women and couples before conception occurs. The PCC, is valuable and key in preventing and controlling non-communicable diseases. There is the need for comprehensive preconception care provision in Kisumu County in order to promote healthy reproduction, improve maternal and neonatal health indicators in this and similar settings. Unfortunately, the current rate of the provision of various services as per the recommended package for preconception care has not been documented in Kenya and more specifically in Kisumu County. In a cross-sectional study, data on the provision of various services as per the recommended package for Preconception care was collected in health facilities using a checklist. The targeted facilities ( n = 28 ) were selected using multistage sampling. The means for all of the services in per the recommended package for preconception care was determined. The significance of the difference in The means for all of the services in the package was determined by one sample T-test at P-value 0.05 Level of implementation of PCC was quite low at 39 %. The significance of the difference in the means was observed to be lower in the primary level facilities ( KEPH level 2 and 3 ) at 34 % and higher in referral facilities ( level 4 and above ) at 45 %. The service with the highest implementation level was HIV prevention and management ( 84 % ) followed by sexually transmitted diseases ( 80 % ) and vaccination services ( 75 % ). The service with the highest implementation level was environmental risk exposure reduction at 13 % for level 2 and 3 followed by management of mental health disorders. Provision of PCC was relatively low at 39 % and provision was fragmented. provision differed across service levels and care packages. "
153732,Implementation strategies for telemental health: a systematic review,2022-05-02,"The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a rapid shift from traditional face-to-face care provision towards delivering mental health care remotely through telecommunications, often referred to as telemental health care. However, the manner and extent of telemental health implementation have varied considerably across settings and areas, and substantial barriers are encountered. There is, therefore, now a need to identify what works best for service users and staff and establish the key mechanisms for efficient integration into routine care. We aimed to identify investigations of pre-planned strategies intended to achieve or improve effective and sustained implementation of telemental health approaches, and to evaluate how different strategies influence implementation outcomes. A systematic review was conducted, with five databases searched for relevant literature using any methodological approach, published between January 2010 and July 202 Studies were eligible for inclusion if published between January 2010 and July 202 Studies took place in secondary or tertiary mental health services and focused on pre-planned strategies for achieving or improving delivery of mental health care through remote communication between mental health professionals or between mental health professionals and service users, family members, unpaid carers, or peer supporters. All included studies were assessed for risk of bias. Data were synthesised using the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change ( ERIC ) compilation of implementation strategies and the taxonomy of implementation outcomes. Results A total of 14 studies were identified which met the inclusion criteria. A variety of implementation strategies were identified, the most commonly reported being Train and educate stakeholders. All included studies reported using a combination of several implementation strategies. Using a combination of implementation strategies appears to be a helpful method of supporting the implementation of telemental health. Further research is needed to test the impact of specific implementation strategies on implementation outcomes. "
153733,Independent Replication and Drug-specificity of an Antidepressant Response Polygenic Risk Score,2022-05-02,"We here examine associations of a recently published polygenic risk score of antidepressant response ( the PRS-AR ) with antidepressant treatment outcomes ( remission and depression score change ) in an independent clinical trial. We not only replicate the PRS-AR for escitalopram, but also find antidepressant interaction effects, suggesting drug-specificity of the PRS-AR. We therefore also tested the utility of the PRS-AR to stratify between antidepressants and demonstrate a 14 % increase in remission rate ( from 43.6 % to 49.7 % ), relative to the randomized remission rate.
